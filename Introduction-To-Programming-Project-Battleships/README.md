   1. Project description:
      
      -Your task is to develop software for a game called "Battleships," where two players or a player and a computer can play against each other on a single local device. The game should provide options for placing ships, shooting, and announcing the result.

   2. Key functionalities:

Placing Ships:
The game should offer an option to place ships on the playing board. Ships can vary in size:

Boats: Size of 2 cells.
Submarines: Size of 3 cells.
Destroyers: Size of 4 cells.
Aircraft Carrier: Size of 5 cells.
Players should have the ability to place their ships with horizontal or vertical orientation.
Game Board:
The game should provide a visualization of the playing board for each player. You can use ASCII graphics to represent the maritime environment.

Moves:
Players take turns by shooting at specific cells on the opponent's playing board.
After each move, the result (hit, miss, or sink) is announced.

End of the Game:
A winner can be declared when all the opponent's ships are sunk.

    3. Additional functionalities:

Saving and Resuming the Game:
Include a feature to save the current state of the game, allowing players to continue later. This can involve saving the positions of the ships, the current player's turn, and other relevant game data.

Dynamic Game Board Size:
Allow for dynamic sizing of the playing board, providing players with the option to choose the dimensions of their playing field. This can add flexibility to the game and enhance the overall gaming experience.

  4. Project contents:


These features contribute to the versatility and replay value of the game, giving players the ability to customize their experience and save their progress for future sessions.
